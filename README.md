# Wild Strikes

**Wild Strikes** is a fast-paced, turn-based strategy battle game inspired by *Wild Ones* and *Axie Infinity*. Players take control of unique warriors, each with their own distinct abilities and skill cards, and engage in tactical, action-packed battles.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

Wild Strikes was created to deliver a fresh, competitive, and fun experience in the turn-based strategy genre. By blending projectile combat with strategic card play, the game challenges players to think critically while reacting quickly. It aims to foster both casual and competitive communities through engaging multiplayer modes like 1v1 duels, Free-for-All, and Ranked Matches.

## ðŸš€ Innovation

- **Turn-Based Combat + Free Movement:** Players can move characters strategically within a time limit and then execute skill cards based on speed.
- **Energy System:** A strategic layer where energy is spent on attacks, defenses, and movementâ€”unused energy rolls over for future turns.
- **Card Mechanics:** Each round provides a new set of cards, encouraging adaptation and planning every turn.
- **NFT Integration:** Players can own, trade, and earn through NFT-based characters, weapons, and skins.
- **Playable Combos:** Skill combos reward strategyâ€”for example, "Shield Bash â†’ Ground Slam" stuns and knocks back enemies in one swoop.

## ðŸ”— Integration with CORE

- **NFT Ownership & Marketplace:** CORE supports blockchain assets, allowing Wild Strikes players to trade and own unique NFTs such as characters, weapons, and cosmetics.
